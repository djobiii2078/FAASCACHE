/**
 * Creates and tracks replicas of local in-memory segments on remote backups.
 *
 * A master's log module issues requests to a ReplicaManager which replicates
 * log data and can be used to free replicas of segments from backups in the
 * cluster.  ReplicaManager also responds to changes in cluster configuration;
 * it restores durability of segments and transparently masks backup failures
 * (both for closed segments and for segments which are actively being written
 * when a backup fails). ReplicaManager tries to mask all failures that can
 * occur in replication (for example, naming, network, or host failures).
 *
 * All operations issued to the ReplicaManager are only queued.  To force all
 * queued operations to complete sync() must be called, otherwise the
 * ReplicaManager casually tries to perform some replication whenever proceed()
 * is called.
 *
 * The log module uses openSegment() to make the ReplicaManager aware of
 * an in-memory segment which must be replicated.  See ReplicatedSegment for
 * details on how the log module informs the ReplicaManager of changes to the
 * in-memory segment image and what guarantees the ReplicaManager provides.
 *
 * There must be exactly one ReplicaManager per log otherwise behavior is
 * undefined.

     * This includes all data being tracked for each individual segment and
     * its replicas as well as helper structures like the #taskQueue and
     * #replicatedSegmentList.  A lock for this mutex must be held to read
     * or modify any state in the ReplicaManager.
     *
     * Locking in ReplicaManager and ReplicatedSegment maintains several
     * important properties:
     * 1) Only one thread is in proceed() at a time. When any thread is
     *    "in" the ReplicaManager performing replication all other threads
     *    are locked out.
     * 2) When multiple threads call sync() simultaneously only one is
     *    admitted at a time and that thread doesn't release locks until
     *    its objects are committed on backups, but sync() still coalesces
     *    operations so that when threads acquire the appropriate locks in
     *    sync they may find their work has already been done by another thread.
     *    There is a subtle starvation problem that can occur which
     *    ReplicatedSegment::syncMutex prevents. See
     *    ReplicatedSegment::sync() for the details.
     * 3) Calls to sync() cannot lock out calls to handleBackupFailure()
     *    indefinitely. Calls to sync() may block forever if they are trying to
     *    communicate with failed servers. Threads sync()ing objects must
     *    release #dataMutex periodically to ensure the BackupFailureMonitor can
     *    modify ReplicatedSegments which have inoperable backups.
     * 4) Part of a handling backup failure may include allocating a new log
     *    head. #dataMutex MUST NOT be held when allocating a head since
     *    log code calls into the ReplicaManager and ReplicatedSegments which
     *    would cause deadlock. Because of this allocating a new log head
     *    in response to backup failures only happens in the
     *    BackupFailureMonitor where it is safe to do so.
