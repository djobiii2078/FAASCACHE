/**
 * This class implements the client side framework for MasterService multi-ops.
 * It manages multiple concurrent RPCs, each requesting one or more objects
 * from a single server. The behavior of this class is similar to an
 * RpcWrapper, but it isn't an RpcWrapper subclass because it doesn't
 * correspond to a single RPC. Implementation-specific information about this
 * class can be found at the top of MultiOp.cc
 *
 * To add a new multi-operation, xxx, to this framework follow these steps:
 *   1) In Ramcloud.h, create a new MultixxxObject that extends MultiOpObject.
 *      This MultixxxObject will serve as a place to pass in parameters
 *      and store server responses.
 *
 *   2) In WireFormat.h, find struct MultiOp. Inside,
 *      2a) Create a new enum OpType to identify your operation.
 *      2b) Create a new struct xxxPart within MultiOp::Request
 *          and MultiOp::Response.
 *
 *   3) In xxx.cc and xxx.h, create a new Multixxx class that extends MultiOp.
 *      3a) Extend the constructor. Contract/Description located in MultiOp.cc
 *      3b) Implement the two PROTECTED virtual functions. Contract/Description
 *          located below.
 *
 *   4) In MasterService.cc, find the MasterService::multiOp, add your
 *      OpType to the switch statement and implement the server-side multi-op.
 *
 *   5) (optional) Add a high-level call in RamCloud.cc for Multixxx
 *
 * See MultiRead and MultiWrite for examples of multi operations using this
 * framework.
