/**
 * The Transaction class provides a client level interface for transactionally
 * performing a set of read, write, and remove operations.  A client would:
 *   1.  construct a Transaction object (*t*),
 *   2.  optimistically perform operations on *t*, and then
 *   3.  attempt to commit the transaction by calling commit on *t*.
 *
 * Transaction commit calls will either:
 *   -   **commit** in which case all performed operations are committed in an
 *       atomic isolated manner; or
 *   -   **abort** in which case effectively no operations are performed.
 * It is the client's responsibility to check the return value of the commit
 * call and retry the transaction upon abort.
 *
 * Each Transaction object represents a single transaction attempt.  Transaction
 * objects should be discarded after the transaction either commits or aborts;
 * a single Transaction object is not intended to be reused to represent
 * multiple transaction attempts.
