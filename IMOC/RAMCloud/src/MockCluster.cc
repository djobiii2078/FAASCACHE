/**
 * Add a new server to the cluster; notice \a config is passed
 * by value; the caller is NOT responsible for freeing the returned Server.
 * A ServerConfig can be obtained from ServerConfig::forTesting
 * which will work for most tests.  From there different tests will need
 * to override a few things.  Most importantly, for any configuration it
 * is important to select which services will run on the server.
 * For example, config.services = {MASTER_SERVICE, ADMIN_SERVICE}.
 * Examples of other things that can be configured include number of
 * replicas, size of segments, number of segment frames on the backup
 * storage, etc.).
 *
 * If config.coordinatorLocator is left blank (which is its default)
 * then the server will enlist with the coordinator which was created
 * along with this cluster.  If config.localLocator is left blank (which
 * is its default) it will be assigned a service locator of
 * "mock:host=serverX" where X starts at 0 and increases each time
 * addServer() is called.  Notice, that because each server contains
 * a copy of its ServerConfig \a config is NOT modified to reflect these
 * tweaks to the service locators.  The generated locators can be obtained
 * from the config field in Server.  In order to reduce breakage with older
 * unit tests and to make for clearer hostnames, its possible to override
 * config.localLocator to control the locator the added server listens at.
 *
 * Look at ServerConfig for all the details on what configuration of
 * a server is possible.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * ServerConfig config = ServerConfig::forTesting();
 * config.services = {BACKUP_SERVICE, ADMIN_SERVICE};
 * auto* backup = cluster.get<BackupClient>(cluster.addServer(config));
 * backup->openSegment({99, 0}, 10);
 *
 * \return
 *      A pointer to the new Server that has been added to the cluster
 *      and enlisted with the coordinator.  The caller is NOT responsible
 *      for freeing the returned Server.
