/**
 * This class defines an interface for storing data durably in a separate
 * key-value store with a hierarchical name space.  An object of this class
 * represents a connection to a particular storage system, such as ZooKeeper.
 * This class is used by the coordinator to store configuration data that
 * must survive coordinator crashes, such as information about cluster
 * membership and tablet locations. This class is also used for leader
 * election (ensuring that there is exactly one server acting as coordinator
 * at a time).
 *
 * The storage provided by this class is expected to be highly durable
 * and available (for example, it might be implemented using a consensus
 * approach with multiple storage servers). No recoverable exceptions or
 * errors should be thrown by this class; the only exceptions thrown should
 * be unrecoverable ones such as LostLeadershipException or internal
 * errors that should result in coordinator crashes. The storage system is
 * expected to be totally reliable; the worst that should happen is for
 * calls to this class to block while waiting for the storage system to
 * come back online.
 *
 * The goal of this interface is to support multiple implementations using
 * different storage systems; however, the interface was designed with
 * ZooKeeper in mind as the storage system.
