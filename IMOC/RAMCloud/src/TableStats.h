 * table's statistics are not recorded separately in the log; instead, a single
 * set of aggregated statistics is recorded for all sub-threshold tables.
 *
 * A threshold of 24MB was selected to both bound the max number of entries we
 * would store in the stats block and ensure that the error the results would be
 * "relatively small" compared to the target partition size.  Some assumed
 * values include:
 *      SegmentSize 8MB
 *      MasterCapacity 64GB
 *      StatsEntrySize 24B
 *      TargetPartitionSize 600MB
 * If we want to keep the stats block under 1% of segment usage we will show:
 *      MaxStatsBlockSize = SegmentSize /128 = 64KB
 * This means we should have always have fewer than MaxEntryCount number of
 * entries:
 *      MaxEntryCount = MaxStatsBlockSize / StatsEntrySize = ((64 * 1024) / 24)B
 * Thus the threshold should be:
 *      threshold = MasterCapacity / MaxEntryCount = 24MB
 * 24MB is also reasonably small compared to the target partition size.  It
 * should be noted that if the MasterCapasity grows we will either need to
 * increase the threshold or increase the number of entries we are willing to
 * store in order to compensate.
