 * The Dispatch class keeps track of interesting events such as open files
 * and timers, and arranges for particular methods to be invoked when the
 * events happen. The inner loop for the class is polling-based, and it
 * allows additional polling-based event handlers to be added.  This
 * implementation works in a multi-threaded environment, but with certain
 * restrictions:
 * - #poll should only be invoked in the thread that created the Dispatch
 *   object.  This thread is called the "dispatch thread".
 * - Other threads can invoke Dispatch methods, but they must hold a
 *   Dispatch::Lock object at the time of the invocation, in order to avoid
 *   synchronization problems.
 * - The Timer methods are thread-safe without acquiring Dispatch::Lock
 *   (use of Dispatch::Lock is now deprecated because it is slow, so we
 *   are gradually eliminating its use).
