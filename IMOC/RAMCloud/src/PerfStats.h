/**
 * An object of this class records various performance-related information.
 * Each server thread has a private instance of this object, which eliminates
 * cash conflicts when updating statistics and makes the class thread-safe.
 * In addition, an object of this class is returned by collectStats, which
 * aggregates the statistics from all of the individual threads (this is
 * used, for example, as a result of the GET_PERF_STATS server control).
 * In order for aggregation to work, each thread must invoke the
 * registerStats method.
 *
 * If you add a new metric, be sure to update all of the relevant methods
 * in PerfStats.cc. For example, search for all of the places where
 * "collectionTime" appears and add appropriate lines for the new metric.
 *
 * This class should eventually replace RawMetrics because it is more
 * efficient (due to its use of thread-local structures).
