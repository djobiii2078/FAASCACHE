/**
 * This class defines the format of an object stored in the log and provides
 * methods to easily construct new ones to be appended and interpret ones that
 * have already been written.
 *
 * In other words, this code centralizes the format and parsing of objects
 * (essentially serialization and deserialization). Different constructors
 * serve these two purposes.
 *
 * Each object contains one or more variable-length keys, a variable-length
 * binary blob of data, and a few other pieces of metadata (such as table
 * id and version).  When stored in the log, an object has the following
 * layout:
 *
 * +---------------+--------+---------------------------+----------+----------+
 * | Object Header | # keys | Cumulative Key Lengths .. | Keys ... | Data ... |
 * +---------------+--------+---------------------------+----------+----------+
 *                 <--------------------- keysAndValue ----------------------->
 *
 * "Object Header" is a structure of type Header, defined below.
 * "# keys" is typedefined below as KeyCount
 * "CumulativeKeyLength" is typedefined below as CumulativeKeyLength
 *
 * Everything except the header and the number of keys is of variable length.
 * If the cumulative key length values are 16 bits each, then
 * the constraint is that the total length of all the keys in an object has
 * to be <= 64K.
 * The length of any key can be calculated using these equations,
 *
 * Length_0 = CumulativeKeyLength_0
 * Length_i = max(0, CumulativeKeyLength_i - CumulativeKeyLength_i-1) for i >= 1
 *
 * If Key_i is not present, CumulativeKeyLength_i = CumulativeKeyLength_i-1.
 * Consequently, Length_i = 0

/**
 * This class describes the format of a tombstone stored in the log and provides
 * methods to easily construct new ones to be appended and interpret ones that
 * have already been written.
 *
 * In other words, this code centralizes the format and parsing of tombstones
 * (essentially serialization and deserialization). Different constructors serve
 * these two purposes.
 *
 * Tombstones serve as records indicating that specific versions of objects have
 * been removed from the system (explicitly due to deletions, or implicitly due
 * to overwrites). They are necessary to avoid resurrecting previously-deleted
 * objects that are still in the log during failure recovery.
 *
 * Internally, tombstones are basically the primary key and some additional
 * metadata. When serialized in the log, tombstones simply consist of a common
 * header, followed immediately by the binary string key. The header is of fixed
 * size, while the latter string is of variable length. For example:
 *
 *             +--------------------------+---------------------+
 *             |     Tombstone Header     |    String Key . . . |
 *             +--------------------------+---------------------+
 *               sizeof(Header)      variable length
 *
 * When creating tombstones, one will typically gather the necessary fields by
 * creating an object first (often to deserialize from what's stored in the log)
 * and then create an instance of this class describing that dead object. The
 * resulting tombstone may then be serialized to a buffer and written to the
 * log.
 *
 * When reading tombstones from the log (or from a segment of the log), one will
 * typically get a buffer referring to a tombstone from a segment or log
 * iterator. Constructing an instance of this class with that buffer will allow
 * the user to deserialize it and access all of its fields and contents.
