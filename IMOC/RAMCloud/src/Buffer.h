/**
 * A Buffer represents a logically linear array of bytes, but allows the
 * array to be stored as a collection of discontiguous chunks of memory.
 * Its purpose is to allow information to be assembled and passed around
 * without having to make copies to maintain contiguity. For example, an
 * incoming network message might be represented with a Buffer, where each
 * chunk holds one packet of the message. This class contains several
 * optimizations to minimize the number of chunks in the Buffer, since these
 * introduce overhead. In many simple cases a Buffer will only contain a
 * single contiguous chunk, which is most efficient.
 *
 * In some cases, the storage for chunks is managed internally by the
 * buffer (about 1KB of storage is available automatically, and additional
 * storage will be malloc-ed if needed). Methods such as alloc, allocAux,
 * emplaceAppend, emplacePrepend, and appendCopy use internal storage.
 *
 * In other cases, the storage for chunks is provided from outside the
 * Buffer (e.g., network packets). Methods such as append incorporate
 * external storage into the Buffer. The Buffer class will notify outside
 * agents when their storage is no longer needed for the Buffer.
