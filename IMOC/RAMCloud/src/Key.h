/**
 * RAMCloud objects can contain multiple keys in addition to the primary key.
 * However, this class is used only for the primary key which is a 2-tuple
 * consisting of a 64-bit table identifier and a binary string key. This
 * class represents that tuple, and allows us to pass Key references around,
 * rather than a 64-bit tableId, void pointer, and a length.
 *
 * This class also caches the hash value of the key, avoiding recomputation
 * when the hash is needed in various layers of the system.
 *
 * Multiple constructors provide convenient ways to construct a key given an
 * entry in the log, a Buffer containing a key (perhaps an RPC request), etc.
 *
 * Note that this class does not manage any memory. It simply creates a wrapper
 * around memory that is assumed to live at least as long as the key object
 * does itself. This is typically not a concern, since keys are usually built
 * in an RPC handler and refer to data either in the request itself, or in the
 * log, both of which remain allocated for the duration of the RPC.
