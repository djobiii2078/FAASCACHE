 *      Buffer containing the desired string; typically an RPC

 * \param length
 *      Total length of the string, including terminating null
 *      character.
 *
 * \return
 *      Pointer that can be used to access the string.  The string is
 *      guaranteed to exist in its entirety and to be null-terminated.
 *      (One condition we don't check for: premature termination via a
 *      null character in the middle of the string).

 *      The buffer isn't large enough for the expected size of the
 *      string.
 * \exception RequestFormatError
