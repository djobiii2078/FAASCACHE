rc_lat and ud_lat are simple 4-byte infiniband ping-pong benchmarks.

rc_lat uses reliable connected queue pairs, whereas ud_lat uses
unreliable datagram queue pairs. 

Each binary is both client and server. The server is run with no
arguments, whereas the client takes an IP address of the server.

These are also reasonable references for infiniband connection setup.
