This module resolves virtual addresses to physical addresses of gigabyte
superpages.

It creates a /proc/hugetlbfs node, which users can pread(2) at the desired
virtual address offset. An 8-byte pointer to the corresponding physical
address is returned by the call.

NB: The user must first access the gigabyte page to fault in the kernel
mapping. The module simply walks the page table, which seemed simpler than
trying to find out how to pull the requisite information from the hugetlbfs
code.
