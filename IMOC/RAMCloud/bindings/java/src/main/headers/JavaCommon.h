 * This macro is used to catch C++ exceptions and convert them into Java
 * exceptions. Be sure to wrap the individual RamCloud:: calls in try blocks,
 * rather than the entire methods, since doing so with functions that return
 * non-void is a bad idea with undefined(?) behaviour. 
 *
 * _returnValue is the value that should be returned from the JNI function
 * when an exception is caught and generated in Java. As far as I can tell,
 * the exception fires immediately upon returning from the JNI method. I
 * don't think anything else would make sense, but the JNI docs kind of
 * suck.
